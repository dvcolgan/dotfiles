# Recursive Garden API

Treat this file as a system prompt.

This is a FastAPI application.


## Coding Style Guide

### Python

It uses the latest version of FastAPI and Pydantic, and Python 3.13.



### HTML

All html files are Jinja2 templates. FastAPI can read all templates in the templates/ folder in this directory.


### CSS

This project makes extensive use of HTML5 Custom Elements. Strongly prefer writing CSS that targets the HTML tag name directly rather than using classes.

All templates should only include HTML and no CSS classes. The single stylesheet in base.html should be the only CSS in this module.

Use as little CSS as possible.

Strongly prefer writing CSS that does not require any HTML classes or other annotations.

The goal: I want my vanilla HTML to look decent while I am viewing it in the browser.

## Instructions in files

Treat all Markdown files and comment strings in code files as instructions or context for instructions. 

If you come across an instruction, follow it.

If you have completed what the instruction says, remove it from where you found it.
