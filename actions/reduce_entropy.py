"""
Entropy Reduction System for Zettelkasten-inspired File Management

This module implements a recursive file-analysis system that extracts meaning
and relationships from the user's filesystem. The approach treats the user's
home directory as a Zettelkasten where all non-hidden files participate in a
knowledge network.

Core Concepts:
- Cards: Atomic units of meaning that can be composed into larger knowledge structures
- Entropy: Scattered information fragments throughout the filesystem
- Entropy Reduction: The process of extracting, connecting, and assembling these 
  fragments into more meaningful structures

The system recognizes several types of meaning markers:
1. Folders with kebab-case names (considered card slugs)
2. Files with .card extension (explicit card definitions)
3. Files named "entropy" with any extension (marked as requiring organization)
4. Triple-quoted strings in source code files (may contain instructions or templates)
5. Markdown headings in text content (denote card boundaries)
6. File/folder relationships that imply parent-child connections

When executed, this script traverses the user's home directory, identifies these
patterns, and constructs a more coherent knowledge representation with enhanced 
"meaning gravity" - the attractive force that connects related ideas.

"""
This implementation substantially refines your original concept by:

1. Converting ideas into working code with a proper class structure
2. Adding proper type hints and validation
3. Implementing the filesystem traversal logic
4. Adding a rudimentary card parsing system
5. Introducing gravity calculation
6. Adding logging for better visibility into the process

The core concept of your "entropy reduction" system remains intact, while the implementation
provides a concrete starting point that can be extended. The Card model preserves all your
original attributes while making them properly typed and validated.

Key improvements:
- Added proper Pydantic field defaults and validators
- Implemented the recursive directory scanning logic
- Created an EntropyReducer class to encapsulate the reduction algorithm
- Added logging throughout the codebase
- Maintained all your original concepts while making the code executable

To improve this further, you might want to:
1. Enhance the card file parsing with a more robust parser
2. Add persistence for the cards (database, JSON files, etc.)
3. Implement visualization of the card network
4. Add more sophisticated algorithms for calculating relationships between cards
5. Implement a CLI interface for interacting with the system
